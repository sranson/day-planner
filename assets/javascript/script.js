// store all save buttons in a variable of some sort

// add an event listener to this variable so that when a button is clicked, I can get
// the id of the button that was clicked

// when I know what button was clicked, I can add the text from that card to localStorage

// once the text is added to localStorage, I can store it in a variable

// Once the data from localStorage is stored in a variable, I can add this to the DOM
// NOTE: I have to figure out how to keep this info in the DOM even when the page is refreshed


// If a time block is in the past, make it [color]

// If a time block is the current time, make it [color]

// if the time block is in the future, make it [color]
